To deploy the Flask web application on a web server, you can follow these general steps:

Set up a server: You'll need a server to host your web application. You can use cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure, or you can choose a web hosting service provider.

Prepare the server environment: Install the necessary dependencies on the server, including Python and any required packages. Make sure the server meets the requirements specified by Flask and your application.

Upload your code: Transfer your Flask application code to the server. You can use tools like FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or SCP (Secure Copy) to upload the files to the server. Alternatively, you can use version control systems like Git to clone the repository directly onto the server.

Install dependencies: If your Flask application relies on any external packages, install them on the server using a package manager like pip. Create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies and ensure a clean environment for your application.

Set up a web server: Configure a web server to handle incoming requests and serve your Flask application. Popular choices for Flask applications include Nginx and Apache. Configure the web server to proxy requests to your Flask application's port (usually running on localhost) using a WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.

Start the application: Activate your virtual environment and start the Flask application using the appropriate command. For example, if your main application file is named app.py, you can start the application with gunicorn app:app if using Gunicorn.

Configure DNS and routing: Set up DNS records to point your domain or subdomain to the IP address of your server. Configure any necessary routing rules or firewalls to allow incoming traffic to your web application.

Test the deployment: Access your web application using the configured domain or IP address to ensure it's functioning correctly. Perform thorough testing to ensure all features are working as expected.

Please note that the deployment process can vary depending on your specific server setup, hosting provider, and configuration requirements. It's recommended to refer to the documentation provided by your hosting provider or the Flask documentation for detailed deployment instructions specific to your environment.
